Heaven\nTheres a lady whos sure\nAll that glitters is gold\nAnd shes buying a stairway to heaven\nWhen she gets there she knows\nIf the stores are all closed\nWith a word she can get what she came for\nOoh ooh and shes buying a stairway to heaven\nTheres a sign on the wall\nBut she wants to be sure\nCause you know sometimes words have two meanings\nIn a tree by the brook\nTheres a songbird who sings\nSometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven\nOoh it makes me wonder\nOoh it makes me wonder\nTheres a feeling I get\nWhen I look to the west\nAnd my spirit is crying for leaving\nIn my thoughts I have seen\nRings of smoke through the trees\nAnd the voices of those who standing looking\nOoh it makes me wonder\nOoh it really makes me wonder\nAnd its whispered that soon\nIf we all call the tune\nThen the piper will lead us to reason\nAnd a new day will dawn\nFor those who stand long\nAnd the forests will echo with laughter\nIf theres a bustle in your hedgerow\nDont be alarmed now\nIts just a spring clean for the May queen\nYes there are two paths you can go by\nBut in the long run\nTheres still time to change the road youre on\nAnd it makes me wonder\nYour head is humming and it wont go\nIn case you dont know\nThe pipers calling you to join him\nDear lady can you hear the wind blow\nAnd did you know\nYour stairway lies on the whispering wind\nAnd as we wind on down the road\nOur shadows taller than our soul\nThere walks a lady we all know\nWho shines white light and wants to show\nHow evrything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard\nThe tune will come to you at last\nWhen all are one and one is all\nTo be a rock and not to roll\nAnd shes buying a stairway to heaven\nSubject Stairway To Heaven first part and the solo\nHi\nHeres the first part of the
