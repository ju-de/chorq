Capo 2th fret.

C    G    D    Em D      (Repeats throughout the entire song)

[[(Verse)]]
[[C]]   And a[[G]]nother one bites the dust[[D]]
But [[Em]]why can I not[[D]] conquer [[C]]love?
And I [[G]]might have got to be with on[[D]]e
Why not [[Em]]fight this war[[D]] without weapon[[C]]s?
And I want [[G]]it and I want everyth[[D]]ing
But [[Em]]there was so many [[D]]red flags[[C]]
Now a[[G]]nother one bites the dust[[D]]
And l[[Em]]ets be clear, I [[D]]trust no on[[C]]e

(Pre-Chorus)
You did n[[G]]ot break m[[D]]e[[Em]][[D]]
[[C]] Im still [[G]]fighting for t[[D]]his[[Em]][[D]]

(Chorus)
[[C]]Well Ive got a thick skin[[G]] and an elastic hea[[D]]rt
But [[Em]]your blade it[[D]] might be too sharp
[[C]]Im like a rubber band[[G]] until you pull too ha[[D]]rd
But [[Em]]I may snap [[D]]when I move close
[[C]]But you wont see me [[G]]move no mor[[D]]e[[Em]][[D]]
[[C]]Cause I ve got an [[G]]elastic h[[D]]eart[[Em]][[D]]
[[C]]Ive got an [[G]]elastic h[[D]]eart[[Em]][[D]]
[[C]]Yeah, I ve got an [[G]]elastic h[[D]]eart[[Em]][[D]]

(Verse)
And now I step through the night
Lets be clear, won t close my eyes
And I know that I can t survive
I walked through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I m doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It s hard to lose a chosen one

(Pre-Chorus)
You did not break me
I m still fighting for this

(Chorus x3)
Well I ve got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I m like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won t see me move no more
Cause I ve got an elastic heart

I ve got an elastic heart
