Take Me To Church
(2x)
              Em
Take me to church                 
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your l[[B]]ies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your k[[G]]nife
Offer me that dea[[Am]]thless death
Good [[Em]]God, let me give you my [[Am-G-F#-Em]]life

(2x)
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work
