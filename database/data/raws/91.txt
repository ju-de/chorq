Intro: G, D, Em, D

[[G]]I'm gonna pick up t[[D]]he pi[[Em]]eces,
and bu[[D]]ild a lego ho[[G]]use
when things go wr[[D]]ong we can kn[[Em]]ock it down[[D]]

[[G]]My three words have t[[D]]wo me[[Em]]anings,
there's one thing [[D]]on my m[[G]]ind
It's all [[D]]fo[[Em]]r you[[D]]

[[G]]And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to k[[D]]eep me w[[Em]]arm[[D]]
and [[G]]if you're broke I'll mend ya and keep you she[[D]]ltered from [[Em]]the storm

[[G]]I'm out of touch, I'm [[D]]out of love[[Em]]
I'll pick you up when you're get[[G]]ting d[[D]]own
And out of all the[[G/B]]se things [[C]]I've done I think I love[[D]] you be[[G]]tter now

[[G]]I'm out of sight, I'm [[D]]out of mind[[Em]]
I'll do it all for yo[[G]]u in ti[[D]]me
And out of all the[[G/B]]se things [[C]]I've done I think I love[[D]] you be[[G]]tter now

Intro

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
and colour you in
if things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall

And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
and I'll surrender up my heart
and swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

[[Em]]Don't [[D]]hold me [[C]]down
I think my br[[D]]aces are breaking and it's [[C]]more than I can t[[D]]ake

And if it's dark in a cold December, I've got ya to keep me warm
and if you're broke I'll mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

Hope this was useful.
Enjoy :)
