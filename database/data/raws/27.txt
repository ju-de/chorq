It is the [[A]]only thing that makes us feel aliv[[G]]e

Prechorus:

[[Bm]]We keep this love in a [[G]]photograph

Where our [[Bm]]eyes are never closing
Our h[[G]]earts were never broken
And t[[D]]imes forever frozen still[[A]]

So you can [[D]]keep me inside the pocket of your
A
Ripped jeans holding me closer till our
[[Bm]]Eyes meet, you won't ever be a[[G]]lone
Wait for me to come home[[D]]

D
Loving can heal
Loving can [[Bm]]mend your soul
And it's the [[A]]only thing that I know[[G]]

And it's the [[A]]only thing till with us without[[G]]

Prechorus:

[[Bm]]We keep this love in a [[G]]photograph

Our h[[G]]earts were never broken
And t[[D]]imes forever frozen sti[[A]]ll

And if you [[D]]hurt me that's ok baby, we'll be
[[A]]Words deep inside these pages you just

Wait for me to come h[[Bm]]ome
Wait for me to come h[[G]]ome
Wait for me to come h[[D]]ome

Oh you can [[D]]fit me inside the necklace you got when you were

And if you [[D]]hurt me that's ok baby only
[[A]]words lead inside these pages you just
[[Bm]]Hold me and I won't ever let yo[[G]]u go

When I'm a[[D]]way I will remember how you

Hearing you whisper through the p[[G]]hone
A
Wait for me to come home
