Tuning: Standard E (capo 1st fret!)

Fading [[G]]in, fading out
On the [[Bm7]]edge of paradise
Every [[Em7]]inch of your skin
is a holy grail I've got to find[[C]]
Only [[D]]you can set my heart on fir[[Em7]]e, on fire

Yeah, I'll [[G]]let you set the pace[[Bm7]]
'Cause [[Em7]]I'm not thinking straight
My [[C]]head spinning around I[[D]] can't see clear no more[[Em7]]
(Gradually mute the Em7)
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus (x2)]
L[[G]]ove me like you do, l-l-[[Bm7]]love me like you do (like you do)
[[Em7]]Love me like you do, l-[[C]]l-love me like you do
[[Am]]Touch me like you do, t-t-[[Em]]touch me like you do
[[Dsus4]]......What are yo[[D]]u waiting for?

L[[G]]ove me like you do, l-l-[[Bm7]]love me like you do (like you do)
[[Em7]]Love me like you do, l-[[C]]l-love me like you do
[[Am]]Touch me like you do, t-t-[[Em]]touch me like you do
[[Dsus4]]......What are yo[[D]]u waiting for?

Yeah, I'll [[G]]let you set the pace[[Bm7]]
'Cause [[Em7]]I'm not thinking straight
My [[C]]head's spinning around I[[D]] can't see clear no more[[Em7]]

What are you waiting for?
