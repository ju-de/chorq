All Of Me
My first song tab/chord submission. Did it all by ear so hopefully it sounds close
to you guys. Don't forget to shout out your boy "RNBTee" if you make a YouTube
video with these chords. :)

Capo 1 Standard D tuning
 (Em, C, G, D)
[[Em]]What would I[[Cmaj7]] do without your sm[[G]]art mouth
Drawing me i[[D]]n, and kicking me o[[Em]]ut
Got my hea[[C]]d spinning, n[[G]]o kidding, I can[[D]]t pin you d[[Em]]own
Whats going o[[Cmaj7]]n in that beautif[[G]]ul mind
Im on your magi[[D]]cal mystery ri[[Em]]de
And Im s[[C]]o dizzy, dont k[[G]]now what hit me, but I[[D]]ll be alri[[Am]]ght

 (Am, Em, D)
[[Am]]My heads under [[G]]water
But [[D]]Im breathing f[[Am]]ine
Youre crazy and [[G]]Im out of my m[[D]]ind

 (G, Em, Am, D)
Cause a[[G]]ll of me
Loves a[[Emadd9]]ll of you
Love your cu[[C]]rves and all your edges
All your pe[[C/D]]rfect imp[[D]]erfections
Give your a[[G]]ll to me
Ill give my [[Emadd9]]all to you
Youre my [[C]]end and my beginning
Even w[[C/D]]hen I lose I[[D]]m winning
Cause I give you a[[Em]]ll, [[C]]all of [[G]]me[[D]]
And you give me a[[Em]]ll, [[C]]all of [[G]]you, [[D]]oh

 (Em, C, G, D)
[[Em]]How many[[C]] times do I have to tell[[G]] you
Even when youre cr[[D]]ying youâ€™re beautifu[[Em]]l too
The world is b[[C]]eating you d[[G]]own, Im ar[[D]]ound through every [[Em]]move
Youre my dow[[C]]nfall, youre my m[[G]]use
My worst dist[[D]]raction, my rhythm and bl[[Em]]ues
I cant stop sin[[C]]ging, its rin[[G]]ging, in [[D]]my head for y[[Am]]ou

Cause I give you a[[Em]]ll, [[C]]all of [[G]]me
And you give me a[[Em]]ll, [[C]]all of [[G]]you, [[D]]oh
