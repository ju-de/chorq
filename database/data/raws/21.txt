 [[Bm]]On a dark desert highway,[[F#]] cool wind in my hair
 [[A]]Warm smell of colitas [[E]]rising up through the air
 [[G]]Up ahead in the distance, [[D]]I saw a shimmering light
 Em
 My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
 F#
 I had to stop for the night

 [[Bm]]There she stood in the doorway; [[F#]] I heard the mission bell
 [[A]]And I was thinking to myself this could be [[E]]heaven or this could be hell
 [[G]]Then she lit up a candle,[[D]] and she showed me the way
 [[Em]]There were voices down the corridor,[[F#]] I thought I heard them say

 Chorus :
 
 [[G]]Welcome to the Hotel Cali[[D]]fornia.
 Such a [[Em]]lovely place, such a[[Bm7]] lovely face
 [[G]]Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[[D]]fornia
 [[Em]]Any time of year (any time of year) you[[F#]] can find it here
Keep on playing the song the way you have over and over and you have got it.  Enjoy.
