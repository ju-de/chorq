Pink
Just Give Me A Reason
Thank you everybody for your contributions! The Bm does sound much better in the chorus than the Cmaj chord.
Its been a long time since i've looked at my account so I'm sorry for the delay but now its fixed.
To address the debate between the D/F# and D chord, i just want to say that you can play either and it will
sound fine! It's just my interpretation of the song. Have some fun with it!! :)
