Intro:
 [[D]]Ah, ah ah [[Bm]]ah
 Ah ah [[G]]ah ah, ah ah [[D]]ah

[[D]] Oh her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Bm
 Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying
[[G]] She's so beautiful, and I tell her every [[D]]day

Yeah,[[D]] I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
Bm
 And it's so, it's so sad to think she don't see what I see
[[G]] But every time she asks me do I look okay, I [[D]]say

Chorus:
When I see your [[D]]face, there's not a [[Bm]]thing that I would change
Cause you're a[[G]]mazing, just the way you [[D]]are
And when you [[D]]smile, the whole world [[Bm]]stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're a[[G]]mazing, just the way you [[D]]are, (yeah)

[[D]] Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Bm
 Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
[[G]] She's so beautiful, and I tell her every [[D]]day

Oh, you [[D]]know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
   Bm
If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
[[G]]So, don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll [[D]]say

Chorus

The way you [[D]]are, the way you [[Bm]]are
Girl you're a[[G]]mazing, just the way you [[D]]are

Chorus
