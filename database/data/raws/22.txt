CAPO 1

Am
Party girls don't get hurt
[[F]]Can't feel anything, when will I learn
[[G]]I push it down, push it d[[Em]]o--own

Am
I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's [[F]]blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
I [[G]]feel the love, feel the l[[Em]]o--ove

[[F]]1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
Am
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
[[G]]1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
[[G]]Throw em back, till I lose count

[[F]]I'm gonna [[G]]swing from the [[C]]chandelier, from the [[F]]chandelier
[[F]]I'm gonna [[G]]live like tomorrow [[C]]doesn't exist, like it [[F]]doesn't exist
[[F]]I'm gonna [[G]]fly like a [[C]]bird through the night, feel my [[F]]tears as they dry
[[F]]I'm gonna [[G]]swing from the [[C]]chandelier, from the [[F]]chandelier

And I'm holding [[F]]on for dear life, won't look down won't [[G]]open my eyes
Keep my glass full un[[C]]til morning light, 'cause I'm just holding [[F]]on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding [[F]]on for dear life, won't look down won't [[G]]open my eyes
Keep my glass full un[[C]]til morning light, 'cause I'm just holding [[F]]on for tonight
[[F]]On for tonight

Am
Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta [[F]]get out now, gotta run from this
Here [[G]]comes the shame, here comes the sh[[Em]]a--ame

[[F]]1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
Am
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
[[G]]1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
[[G]]Throw em back, till I lose count

[[F]]I'm gonna [[G]]swing from the [[C]]chandelier, from the [[F]]chandelier
[[F]]I'm gonna [[G]]live like tomorrow [[C]]doesn't exist, like it [[F]]doesn't exist
[[F]]I'm gonna [[G]]fly like a [[C]]bird through the night, feel my [[F]]tears as they dry
[[F]]I'm gonna [[G]]swing from the [[C]]chandelier, from the [[F]]chandelier

And I'm holding [[F]]on for dear life, won't look down won't [[G]]open my eyes
Keep my glass full un[[C]]til morning light, 'cause I'm just holding [[F]]on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding [[F]]on for dear life, won't look down won't [[G]]open my eyes
Keep my glass full un[[C]]til morning light, 'cause I'm just holding [[F]]on for tonight
[[F]]On for tonight
[[F]]On for tonight

And there's a bit of extra riffing at the end with the lyric "on for tonight, 'cause I'm just holding
for tonight" and the same F G C F chord progression as above.

Happy playing! :D
