Hozier - Take Me To Church

Verse 1
[[Em]] My lover's got[[Am]] hu[[Em]]mor, she's the giggle at[[Am]] a [[G]]funeral
Knows everybody's disappr[[Am]]ova[[Em]]l, I should've worshipped her[[Am]] so[[Em]]oner
If the Heavens ever [[Am]]did spea[[Em]]k, sheâ€™s the last tr[[Am]]ue mouth[[G]]piece
Every Sunday's getting m[[Am]]ore ble[[Em]]ak, a fresh poison[[Am]] each w[[D]]eek
We were born sick,[[C]] you heard them say it
[[Em]] My church offers no[[Am]] absolu[[Em]]tes, she tells me 'worship in t[[Am]]he bedr[[G]]oom'
The only heaven I'll be [[Am]]sent [[Em]]to is when I'm alone[[Am]] with [[D]]you
I was born sick[[C]], but I love it. Command me to be well

Ay Ay Ay Ay [[G]]Ay  [[C]]Am[[G]]en [[Cm]]Am[[G]]en[[Cm]] A[[G]]men
