Bon Iver
Skinny Love
This song is normally played with the guitar tuned in C, which is a bit of a hassle. So
worked out a very simple version in standard tuning.
Unfortunately it doesn't fit playing along with song but for just singing along to it's
Enjoy!

Intro
Am C x 3 G Am

verse
[[Am]]Come on skinny [[C]]love just last the year
[[Am]]Pour a little [[C]]salt we were never here
My, my, [[Am]]my, my, my,[[C]] my, my, my
Staring at the [[G]]sink of blood and crushed v[[Am]]eneer
[[Am]]I tell my[[C]] love to wreck it all
[[Am]]Cut out all the[[C]] ropes and let me fall
My, my, [[Am]]my, my, my,[[C]] my, my, my
Right in the [[G]]moment this order's t[[Am...]]all

Chorus
  C
I told you to be patient
I [[G]]told you to be[[F]] fine
  C
I told you to be balanced
I [[G]]told you to be [[F]]kind
In the [[C]]morning I'll be with you
But it will [[G]]be a different "[[F]]kind"
I'll be [[C]]holding all the tickets
And you'll be [[G]]owning all the [[F]]fines

verse

[[Am]]Come on skinny [[C]]love what happened here
[[Am]]Suckle on the[[C]] hope in lite brassiere
My, my, [[Am]]my, my, my,[[C]] my, my, my
Sullen load is [[G]]full; so slow on the s[[Am]]plit

Chorus
  C
I told you to be patient
I [[G]]told you to be[[F]] fine
  C
I told you to be balanced
I [[G]]told you to be [[F]]kind
Now [[C]]all your love is wasted?
Then [[G]]who the hell was [[F]]I?
Now I'm [[C]]breaking at the britches
And at the [[G]]end of all your [[F]]lines
[[C]]Who will love you?
[[G]]Who will f[[F]]ight?
[[C]]Who will fall [[G]]far behi[[F]]nd?
