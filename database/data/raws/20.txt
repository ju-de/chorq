G
White lips, pale face,
Breathing in s[[F#*]]nowf[[Em]]lakes,
Burnt lungs,[[C]] sour ta[[G]]ste.
G
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to [[F#*]]pay [[Em]]rent,
Long nights,[[C]] strange[[G]] men.

[[Am]]And they say she's in the[[Cadd9]] Class A Team,
Stuck in[[G]] her daydream,
Been this way sin[[D]]ce 18, but lately h[[Am]]er face seems
Slowly sinking, wa[[Cadd9]]sting
Crumbling like p[[G]]astries

And they scream
D
The worst things in life come free to us,
[[Em]]Cuz we're just under [[Cadd9]]the upper hand
G
And go mad for a couple of grams
[[Em]]And she don't wa[[Cadd9]]nt to go o[[G]]utside tonight
And in a pi[[Em]]pe she flies to the M[[Cadd9]]otherland
Or[[G]] sells love to an[[(D)]]ot[[optional]]her man,
[[Em]]It's too c[[Cadd9]]old outside[[G]]
[[G]]For angels to f[[Em]]ly[[C]][[G]]
[[G]]Angels to fly[[Em]][[C]][[G]]

G
Ripped gloves, and raincoat,
Tried to swim and [[F#*]]stay[[Em]] afloat,
Dry house, w[[C]]et cloth[[G]]es.
G
Loose change, bank notes,
Weary-eyed, dry th[[F#*]]roat[[Em]],
Call girl, n[[C]]o phone.[[G]]
