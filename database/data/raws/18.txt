I hope he buys you [[F]]flowers[[G]], I hope he holds your [[C]]hand
Give you all his [[F]]hours[[G]] when he has[[C]] the chance
Take you to every [[F]]party cause I [[G]]remember how much you [[Am]]love to dance
[[D7]]Do all the things I[[F]] should've don[[Fm]]e when I was you[[C]]r man
[[D7]]Do all the things I[[F]] should've don[[Fm]]e when I was you[[C]]r man
