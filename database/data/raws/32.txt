A Thousand Years
A Thousand Years                    Christina Perri

[[C]]Heart beats fast
Colors and [[G]]promises
How to be [[Em]]brave
How can I [[D]]love when I'm [[C]]afraid

To fall
But watching you [[G]]stand alone
All of my [[Em]]doubt
Suddenly [[D]]goes away [[C]]somehow
One step [[Em]]close[[D]]r
[[G]]I have died everyday

waiting for you
Em
Darlin' don't be afraid

I have loved you for a
[[C]]Thousand years

I'll love you for a
[[D]]Thousand more
[[C]]Time stands still
beauty in [[G]]all she is
I will be [[Em]]brave
I will not [[D]]let anything
[[C]]Take away
What's standing in [[G]]front of me
Every [[Em]]breath,
Every [[D]]hour has come to [[C]]this
One step [[Em]]clos[[D]]er

[[G]]I have died everyday

Waiting for you
Em
Darlin' don't be afraid

I have loved you for a
[[C]]Thousand years

I'll love you for a
[[D]]Thousand more
And [[G]]all along I believed

I would find you
Em
Time has brought

Your heart to me

I have loved you for a
[[C]]Thousand years

I'll love you for a
[[D]]Thousand more
[[C]]One step [[Em]]clos[[D]]er
[[C]]One step [[Em]]clos[[D]]er
[[G]]I have died everyday

Waiting for you
Em
Darlin' don't be afraid,

I have loved you for a
[[C]]Thousand years

I'll love you for a
[[D]]Thousand more
And [[G]]all along I believed

I would find you
Em
Time has brought

Your heart to me

I have loved you for a
[[C]]Thousand years

I'll love you for a
[[D]]Thousand more
