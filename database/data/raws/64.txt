CAPO: 3

All I am[[C]] is a m[[Am]]an
I want the w[[Em]]orld in my [[G]]hands
I hate the [[C]]beach
But I s[[Am]]tand in[[Em]] California
with my toes in the [[G]]sand
Use the sleeves on my [[C]]sweater
Let's have an [[Am]]adventure
Head in the [[Em]]clouds but my gravity's[[G]] centered
Touch my [[C]]neck and I'll touch [[Am]]yours
You in those [[Em]]little high waisted[[G]] shorts

Oh
[[C]]She knows what I think about
Am
And what I think about
Em
One love, two mouths
[[G]]One love, one house
[[C]]No shirt, no blouse
Am
Just us, you find out
[[Em]]Nothing I really wanna tell you about,[[G]] no
'Cause it's too [[C]]cold w[[Am]]hoa
For you[[Em]] here
And [[G]]now
So let me [[C]]hold [[Am]]whoa
Both your h[[Em]]ands in the [[G]]holes of my sweater

[[C]]And if I may just take your breath away
Am
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Em
Sometimes the silence guides your mind
[[G]]So move to a place so far away
[[C]]The goosebumps start to race
Am
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
Em
And then I watched your face
[[G]]Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste yeah
[[C]]These hearts adore
Am
Everyone the other beat hard is for
Em
Inside this place is warm
[[G]]Outside it starts to pour
[[C]]Coming down
Am
One love, two mouths
Em
One love, one house
[[G]]No shirt, no blouse
[[C]]Just us, you find out
Am
Nothing I really wanna tell you about
Em    G
No No No!
'Cause it's too [[C]]cold [[Am]]whoa
For you[[Em]] here
And [[G]]now
So let me [[C]]hold [[Am]]whoa
Both your h[[Em]]ands in the [[G]]holes of my sweater

'Cause it's too [[C]]cold [[Am]]whoa
For you[[Em]] here
And [[G]]now
So let me [[C]]hold [[Am]]whoa
Both your h[[Em]]ands in the [[G]]holes of my sweater

Am,G,D

[[Am]]Whoa, [[G]]Whoa, Whoa, [[D~]]Whoa,

[[Am]]Whoa, [[G]]whoa...
[[D]]Whoa, whoa...(x4)

'Cause it's too [[C]]cold [[Am]]whoa
For you[[Em]] here
And [[G]]now
So let me [[C]]hold [[Am]]whoa
Both your h[[Em]]ands in the [[G]]holes of my sweater

'Cause it's too [[C]]cold [[Am]]whoa
For you[[Em]]...
And [[G]]now
So let me [[C]]hold [[Am]]whoa
Both your h[[Em]]ands in the [[G]]holes of my sweater[[C~]]

It's too [[Am~]]cold, it's too c[[Em~]]old
G~
The hands of my sweater.
