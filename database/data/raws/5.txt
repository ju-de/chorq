Em7
Me so hey, lets be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
A
Grab your passport and my hand
[[G]]I can make the bad guys [[A]]good for a weekend

[[D]] So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames[[Bm]]
You can tell me when it's over mmm
If the high was worth the pain[[Em]]
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane[[G]]
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game[[D]]

(D)
Cause were young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far[[Bm]]
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar[[Em]]
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane[[G]]
But I got a blank space ba[[G*/mute]]by and I'll write yo[[D]]ur name

D
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible [[Bm]]things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your [[Em7]]queen
[[Find]]Be[[out]] t[[what]]ha[[you]]t [[want]]girl for a month
[[G]]Wait the worst is yet to co[[A]]me, oh no[[D]]

[[(D)]]Screaming crying perfect storms
I can make all the tables [[Bm]]turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing
Like "[[G]]Oh my god who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But [[A]]you'll come back each time you leave
Cause darlin' I'm a nightmare, [[G*/mute]]dressed like a daydream

[[D]] So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames[[Bm]]
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain[[Em]]
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane[[G]]
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game[[D]]

(D)
Cause were young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far[[Bm]]
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar[[Em]]
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane[[G]] (insane)
But I got a blank space ba[[G*/mute]]by and I'll write your name

[[D]] Boys only want [[A]]love if it's torture
[[Bm]] Don't say I didn't,[[A]] say I didn't warn you
[[D]] Boys only want [[A]]love if it's torture
Bm*
 Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you

[[D]] So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames[[Bm]]
You can tell me when it's over mmm
If the high was worth the pain[[Em]]
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane[[G]]
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game[[D]]

Cause were young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far[[Bm]]
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar[[Em]]
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane[[G]]
But I got a blank space ba[[G*/mute]]by and I'll write your name

Have fun!
