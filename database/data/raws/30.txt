is a great acoustic version of this song that i based this tab off.

in the Chorus a B or B7 is fine depending if your playing the original or acoustic version

b7 = x2120x in hoziers's version
F# = 244xxx

enjoy and rate if its helped you!!

[[Em]]My lover's got[[Am]] humo[[Em]]ur
She's the giggle at a f[[Am]]uneral[[G]]
Knows everybody's disap[[Am]]proval[[Em]]
I should've worshipped her s[[Am]]ooner[[Em]]
If the Heavens ever d[[Am]]id spe[[Em]]ak
She is the last true [[Am]]mouth p[[G]]iece
Every Sunday's getting m[[Am]]ore ble[[Em]]ak
A fresh poison e[[Am]]ach w[[D]]eek
'We were born sick,[[C]] you heard them say it[[Em]]
My church offers no ab[[Am]]solut[[Em]]es
She tells me 'worship in the [[Am]]bedro[[G]]om'
The only heaven I'll be s[[Am]]ent [[Em]]to
Is when I'm alone w[[Am]]ith [[D]]you
I was born sick[[C]], but I love it
Command me to be well
[[G]]Aaaaaaa[[C]]aa    [[G]]aaaaaaaa[[Cm]]amen. Aa[[G]]aaaaaam[[Cm]]en[[G]]. Am[[G-F#/F#]]en[[Em]]

              Em
Take me to church                 
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your l[[B7]]ies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your k[[G]]nife
Offer me that dea[[Am]]thless death
Good [[Em]]God, let me give you my [[Am-G-G-F#]]lif[[=]]e[[*power]][[chords]]
