[[C]] Let me go
 I don't wanna [[Am]]be you[[Em]]r hero
 I don't wanna be a b[[F]]ig man
 Just wanna f[[C]]ight like everyone [[G]]else

 Your m[[C]]asquerade
 I don't wanna be a [[Am]]part of your [[Em]]parade
 Everyone deserves a c[[F]]hance to
 W[[C]]alk with everyon[[G]]e else

 While hol[[C]]ding down
 A job to keep my [[Am]]girl ar[[Em]]ound
 And maybe buy me some n[[F]]ew strings
 And her and[[C]] I out on the w[[G]]eekends

 And we can w[[C]]hisper things
 Secrets from my A[[Am]]merica [[Em]]dreams
 Baby needs some p[[F]]rotection
 But I'm a ki[[C]]d like everyone [[G]]else

 So l[[C]]et me go
 I don't wanna be [[Am]]your[[Em]] hero
 I don't wanna be a b[[F]]ig man
 Just wanna [[C]]fight with everyone [[G]]else

  C Am Em
 Ooooohh
 F C G C
 Ooooohh
