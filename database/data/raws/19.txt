Taylor Swift
Blank Space
The other version has some mistakes, and I think capo on 5 sounds cooler.

*PLAY IT HOW TAYLOR DOES IT IN THE VOICE MEMO:
PUT THE CAPO ON 3 BUT KEEP THESE CHORDS SHAPES. THAT MEANS: DO NOT TOUCH THE TRANSPOSING TOOL)
BUT DO PRESS OVER THE HIGH E STRING, 3TH FRET ON ALL THE NOTES EXCEPT IN THE Dm. I KNOW IT'S A BIG
STRETCH BUT I'VE SEEN HER DO IT AND  IF TAYLOR CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT TOO!*

EDITS:
Thanks to catherinet227 for the lyrics correction and mfulms21 for noting a missing G at the end of the
chorus, or sometimes a lack of it.

* = play once quickly and stop or don't play it at all and stop before it.
