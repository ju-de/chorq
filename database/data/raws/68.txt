Well, [[C]]you done done me and you bet I felt it
  G

[[C]]before the cool done run out i'll be givin it my best test
[[G]]and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
[[Am]]I reckon it's again my turn to[[F]] win some or learn some

[[C]]I won't hesit[[G]]ate no more,
no m[[Am]]ore, it cannot [[F]]wait i'm yours

[[C]]Well open up your mind and see like [[G]]me
open up your plans and damn you're f[[Am]]ree
look into your heart and you'll find l[[F]]ove love love
[[C]]listen to the music at the moment maybe sing with m[[G]]e
Ah, la peaceful melod[[Am]]y
It's your god forsaken right to be l[[F]]oved loved loved loved Loved
