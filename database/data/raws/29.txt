I never miss a [[Am*]]beat
I'm lightening on my [[C*]]feet
And that's what they dont' [[G]]see, mmm
That's what they dont' see, mmm
I'm dancing on my [[Am]]own (dancing on my own)
I'll make the moves up as I [[C]]go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't [[G]]know, mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm

But I keep [[Am]]cruisin'
Can't stop won't stop [[C]]groovin'
It's like I got this [[G]]music in my mind

Saying it's gonna be alright

Cause the [[Am]]players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the [[C]]haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby

About the liars and dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been gettin' down to this sick beat

[[Am]]My ex man brought his[[C]] new girlfriend
