5 Seconds Of Summer
Amnesia

Capo 2nd fret to match with studio version

I [[C]]drove by all the places we used to [[F]]hang out getting wasted
I [[C]]thought about our last kiss the way it [[F]]felt the way you tasted
and [[Am]]even though your friends tell me youre[[F]] doing fine
and youre [[C]]somewhere feeling lonely even [[F]]though hes right beside you
when he [[C]]says those words that hurt you do you [[F]]read the ones I wrote you?

Some[[Am]]times I start to wonder was it[[F]] just a lie?
If [[Am]]what we had was real how could[[F]] you be fine?

Cause Im not fine at all

I re[[C]]member the day you told me you were [[F]]leaving
I re[[Am]]member the makeup running down your[[F]] face
and the [[C]]dreams you left behind you didnt [[F]]need them
like [[Am]]every single wish we ever[[F]] made

I [[C]]wish that I could wake up with a[[F]]mnesia
for[[Am]]get about the stupid little[[F]] things
like the [[C]]way it felt to fall asleep next [[F]]to you
and the [[Am]]memories I never can[[F]] escape

cause Im not fine at all

The [[C]]pictures that you sent me theyre still l[[F]]iving in my phone
Ill ad[[C]]mit I like to see them Ill ad[[F]]mit I feel alone
[[Am]]all my friends keep asking why Im[[F]] not around
it [[C]]hurts to know youre happy and it [[F]]hurts that youve moved on
its [[C]]hard to hear your name when I havent [[F]]seen you in so long

Its [[Am]]like we never happened was it[[F]] just a lie?
If [[Am]]what we had was real how could[[F]] you be fine?

Cause Im not fine at all

I [[C]]remember the day you told me you were [[F]]leaving
I [[Am]]remember the makeup running down your[[F]] face
and the [[C]]dreams you left behind you didnt [[F]]need them
like [[Am]]every single wish we ever[[F]] made

I [[C]]wish that I could wake up with [[F]]amnesia
for[[Am]]get about the stupid little[[F]] things
like the [[C]]way it felt to fall asleep next [[F]]to you
and the [[Am]]memories I never can[[F]] escape

If [[Am]]today I woke up with you right beside me
like [[F]]all of this was just some twisted dream
Id [[Am]]hold you closer than I ever did before
and youd [[F]]never slip away
and youd [[F]]never hear me say

I re[[C]]member the day you told me you were [[F]]leaving
I [[Am]]remember the makeup running down your[[F]] face
and the [[C]]dreams you left behind you didnt [[F]]need them
like [[Am]]every single wish we ever[[F]] made

I [[C]]wish that I could wake up with [[F]]amnesia
for[[Am]]get about the stupid little[[F]] things
like the [[C]]way it felt to fall asleep next [[F]]to you
and the [[Am]]memories I never can[[F]] escape

Cause Im not fine at all
