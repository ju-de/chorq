Capo on 1st fret

When the days ar[[D]]e cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints w[[Bm]]e see
Are all made of[[G]] gold

When your dreams all[[D]] fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst o[[Bm]]f all
And the blood’[[G]]s run stale

[[D]]   I want to hide the truth[[A]]
I want to shelter you[[Bm]]
But with the beast inside[[G]]
There’s nowhere we can hide

[[D]]  No matter what we breed[[A]]
We still are made of greed[[Bm]]
This is my kingdom come[[G]]
This is my kingdom come
