Verse 1:
[[G]]Going out tonight, changes into something red
[[Em]]Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
[[Bm]]Everything she never had
She’s showin[[D]]g off
G
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
[[Em]]She said it was something that she won’t forget
[[Bm]]Having no regrets is all that she really [[D]]wants

Chorus:
[[C]]We're only getting [[D]]older baby
[[C]]And I've been thinking [[D]]about it lately
[[C]]Does it ever [[D]]drive you crazy
[[G]]Just how [[D]]fast the [[Em]]night changes
[[C]]Everything that you've [[D]]ever dreamed of
[[C]]Disappearing [[D]]when you wake up
[[C]]But there’s nothing t[[D]]o be afraid of
[[G]]Even [[D]]when the [[Em]]night changes
[[C]]It will never [[D]]change me and you

Verse 2:
G
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running ‘round her head
[[Em]]He’s waiting, hides behind his cigarette
[[Bm]]Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to [[D]]stop
G
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
[[Em]]She’s falling, doesn't even know it yet
[[Bm]]Having no regrets is all that she really [[D]]wants

Chorus:
[[C]]We're only getting [[D]]older baby
[[C]]And I've been thinking [[D]]about it lately
[[C]]Does it ever [[D]]drive you crazy
[[G]]Just how [[D]]fast the [[Em]]night changes
[[C]]Everything that you've [[D]]ever dreamed of
[[C]]Disappearing [[D]]when you wake up
[[C]]But there’s nothing t[[D]]o be afraid of
[[G]]Even [[D]]when the [[Em]]night changes
[[C]]It will never [[D]]change me and [[A]]you
