I Wont Give Up
Capo on 2nd                                           Tabbed by Dirk Jongen. 
                                      
When I look int[[G]]o you[[D]]r eyes
It's like watching the n[[G]]ight s[[D]]ky
Or a beaut[[G]]iful sunr[[D]]ise
There's so much they ho[[A]]ld
And just like them [[G]]old st[[D]]ars
I see that you've co[[G]]me so f[[D]]ar
To be right where y[[G]]ou a[[D]]re
How old is your so[[A]]ul?
  
I won't giv[[G]]e up on u[[D]]s
Even if the[[Bm]] skies get r[[A]]ough
I'm giving you a[[G]]ll my lo[[D]]ve
I'm still looking [[A]]up
     
And when you're needing y[[G]]our s[[D]]pace
To do some [[G]]navigatin[[D]]g
I'll be here pati[[G]]ently wai[[D]]ting
To see what you fi[[A]]nd
   
'Cause even th[[G]]e stars th[[D]]ey burn
Some even f[[Bm]]all to the ea[[A]]rth
We've got a l[[G]]ot to lea[[D]]rn
God knows we're worth i[[A]]t
No, I won't give [[G]]up

I don't wan[[G]]na be someone who wal[[G]]ks away so e[[G]]asily
I'm here to st[[G]]ay and make the difference that [[A]]I can make
Our differ[[G]]ences they do a lo[[G]]t to teach us how to us[[G]]e
The tools and gifts we go[[G]]t yeah, we got a lot at [[A]]stake
And in the e[[C]]nd, you're still my fr[[C]]iend at least we did intend
For us to wo[[C]]rk we didn't break, we didn't burn
[[A]]We had to learn[[A]] how to bend[[A]] without the world caving in
[[C]]I had to learn[[C]] what I've got,[[C]] and what I'm not
And who I [[A]]am

Then Chorus 3x
