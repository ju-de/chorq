Vance Joy
Riptide
Depending on which recording you're listening to, he may or may not be playing a half
step up. So you
 can either throw a capo on 1 if you want, or just fiddle with the tuning, or (my
personal fave) just go
for it in open tuning.
The only chords you use in this song are Am, G, C, and very briefly F. (If you're
feelin' fancy, you can
 play the Fadd9 that he uses, but whatev). Also, I would tab out the fingerpicking, and
I might do it
later, but I just figured this out on my ukulele and I'm too lazy to go get my guitar
and figure it out
 right now.

it in no time at all.
